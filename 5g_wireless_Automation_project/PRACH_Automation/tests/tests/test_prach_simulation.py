'''
What This Code is Doing?
Imports PrachSimulation from a parent directory.
Defines test functions to check different scenarios.
Breakdown of Tests
test_low_load_success()

Simulates a scenario with 10 UEs (low load).
Expects 100% success rate and 0% collision.
test_high_load_collision()

Simulates 100 UEs (high load).
Expects reduced success rate and some collisions.
test_network_check()

Checks whether the network status is either "Connected" or "Disconnected".
Testing Method Used
The script uses assertions (assert) to verify expected vs actual results.
If an assertion fails, it raises an AssertionError indicating a test failure.
âœ… This is a basic unit testing approach without using a formal testing framework like pytest or unittest
